# Machine Comprehension with Neural Networks and LSTM cells
## Presentation at Machine Learning Gda≈Ñsk 03.07.2017
This talk focused on some philosophical implications of machine comprehension from the angle of a simple, popular argument by John Searle.
Then, I proceed to describe one paper on a neural network multi-stage comprehension algorithm using LSTM cells.
